# Why automate? Cell scoring revisited
Given a multichannel fluorescent image, we can:

* Identify and count total cells 
* Score the number/proportion of cell that are positive for 2 different markers

> "That looks great! Now repeat it with 4 genotypes, 5 treatments, 3 concentrations, 3 fields of view and 5 replicates. Oh, and it could have a developmental effect, so maybe image it over 4 time points."

Thankfully, computers are really good at automating repetitive tasks.

Let's remind ourselves of the process for scoring cells manually:

1. Split the DAPI, Ki67 and Ph3 channels, so we can work on them separately.
2. Segment DAPI:
    1. Threshold using Li AutoThreshold.
    2. Watershed to split cells.
3. Segment Ki67:
    1. Threshold using Li AutoThreshold.
4. Segment Ph3:
    1. Threshold using Li AutoThreshold.
5. Count cells in DAPI binary using Particle Analysis
6. Count cells in Ki67 binary using Particle Analysis
7. Count cells in Ph3 binary using Particle Analysis

Note: We will introduce Geodesic reconstruction again later.

# Rapid re-intro to Python programming
Don't worry about the details, the aims are:

* Taste for the logic involved in automating an image analysis workflow.
* Plan early for automation.



```python
# This is a comment
"""So is this"""

# Basic Types and Variables
variable = "This is a string of characters or simply a string"
another_variable = "Hello, world!"
five = 5
exact = 10.23
liar = True

# We can also define functions. Think of these like
# a mathematical function.
# e.g. y = xÂ²
def square(x):
	return x*x
	
y = square(2)
print y 				# outputs 4

# It doesn't have to be mathematical though
def say_hello(name):
	print "Hello, " + name
	
say_hello("john") 		# outputs: Hello, John
```

We will also makes used of many functions/tools that are define by ImageJ and it plugins.
